    "In this ungraded lab, we will explain the stack semantics in Trax. This will help in understanding how to use layers like `Select` and `Residual` which operate on elements in the stack.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "If you've taken a computer science class before, you will recall that a stack is a data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. That is, whatever is the latest element that is pushed into the stack will also be the first one to be popped out. If you're not yet familiar with stacks, then you may find this [short tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python_data_structure/python_stack.htm) useful. In a nutshell, all you really need to remember is it puts elements one on top of the other. You should be aware of what is on top of the stack to know which element you will be popping first. You will see this in the discussions below. Let's get started!"

    "\r\n",
    "To understand how stack-orientation works in [Trax](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) most times one will be using the `Serial` layer. In order to explain the way stack orientation works we will define two simple `Function` layers: 1) Addition and 2) Multiplication.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Suppose we want to make the simple calculation (3 + 4) * 15 + 3. `Serial` will perform the calculations in the following manner `3` `4` `add` `15` `mul` `3` `add`. The steps of the calculation are shown in the table below. The first column shows the operations made on the stack and the second column the output of those operations. **Moreover, the rightmost element in the second column represents the top of the stack** (e.g. in the second row, `Push(3)` pushes `3 ` on top of the stack and `4` is now under it). In the case of operations such as `add` or `mul`, we will need to `pop` the elements to operate before making the operation. That is the reason why inside `add` you will find two `pop` operations, meaning that we will pop the two elements at the top of the stack and sum them. Then, the result is pushed back to the top of the stack.\r\n",

Then, we Select to add in an ordered manner to the top of the stack which after the command is `3` `4` `3` `4`. The steps of the calculation for our example are shown in the table below. As in the previous table each column shows the contents of the stack and the outputs after the operations are carried out. Remember that for `add` or `mul`, we will need to `pop` the elements to operate before making the operation. So the two `pop` operations inside the `add`/`mul` will mean that the two elements at the top of the stack will be popped and then operated on; the other elements will keep their positions in the stack.

    "Here, we use the Serial combinator to define our model. The inputs first go through a `Select` layer, followed by a `Residual` layer which passes the `Fn: Addition()` layer as an argument. What this means is the `Residual` layer will take the stack top input at that point and add it to the output of the `Fn: Addition()` layer. You can picture it like the diagram the below, where `x1` and `x2` are the inputs to the model:\r\n",

This means the duplicate inputs (i.e. the 2 rightmost arrows of the `Select` outputs in the figure above) remain in the stack. This is why you still see it in the output of our simple serial network (i.e. `array([3]), array([4])`).
