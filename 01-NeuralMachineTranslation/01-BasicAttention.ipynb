In the attention operation, the encoder outputs are weighted based on the decoder hidden state, then combined into one context vector. This vector is then used as input to the decoder to predict the next output step.\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "To implement this, first concatenate the encoder and decoder hidden states to produce an array with size $K \\times 2n$ where $K$ is the number of encoder states/steps. For this, use `np.concatenate` ([docs](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.concatenate.html)). Note that there is only one decoder state so you'll need to reshape it to successfully concatenate the arrays. The easiest way is to use `decoder_state.repeat` ([docs](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.repeat.html#numpy.repeat)) to match the hidden state array size.\r\n",
