    "# Calculating the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score: Ungraded Lab\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In this ungraded lab, we will implement a popular metric for evaluating the quality of machine-translated text: the BLEU score proposed by Kishore Papineni, et al. in their 2002 paper [\"BLEU: a Method for Automatic Evaluation of Machine Translation\"](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P02-1040.pdf), the BLEU score works by comparing \"candidate\" text to one or more \"reference\" translations. The result is better the closer the score is to 1. Let's see how to get this value in the following sections.\r\n",

    "We will first start by importing the Python libraries we will use in the first part of this lab. For learning, we will implement our own version of the BLEU Score using Numpy. To verify that our implementation is correct, we will compare our results with those generated by the [SacreBLEU library](https://github.com/mjpost/sacrebleu). This package provides hassle-free computation of shareable, comparable, and reproducible BLEU scores. It also knows all the standard test sets and handles downloading, processing, and tokenization."
